# Overview

This file shows you the recommended pathway to contriubte a change from start to finish for changes to DTXManiaNX.

As part of your contribution, you must be prepared to provide a working build with app screenshots summarizing changes you've made.
For inexperienced contributors doing minor changes, this may feel like a huge barrier to contribution.
Please don't be discouraged by this requirement: the project team is friendly and helpful and will answer any questions you might have.

The guidelines are not meant to discourage contributions. 
They are designed to help you produce a successful PR and get that PR merged into the main branch so others can benefit from your hard work.

## Before you start

Before you start changing the codebase, get set up for success so your pull request has the best chance of being merged.

### Discuss the change

Before making a significant code or documentation contribution to the project, make sure you have done the following:

* Searched for an open issue in https://github.com/limyz/DTXmaniaNX/issues  
* Created an issue in https://github.com/limyz/DTXmaniaNX/issues describing the proposed fix.

It is recommended that you also ask whether the suggested change is worthwhile pursuing in [https://discord.gg/Q8xeugf](https://discord.gg/Q8xeugf) just in case another contributor can save you time or offer assistance.

### Fork the repository

Direct commits to the main repository are protected, so you must create a fork of https://github.com/limyz/DTXmaniaNX before starting development.

### Set up your local environment

To make sure the change does not break any functionality in the app, the project team relies on quality contributions that can be tested and verified.

DTXManiaNX is written in .NET C# and therefore requires the following software and developer frameworks to create a build of the app:

* .NET Framework 4.7.1 Developer Pack

* DirectX End-User Runtime v9.0c

* An IDE such as Visual Studio Code that provides support for editing and building .NET apps.

Install all software before continuing.

### Develop in a branch within your fork

Create a branch in your fork beginning with the issue number, your GitHub ID, and a brief description of what the branch will offer when submitted.

For example `123-jaredmorgs-add-contribution-instructions`.

Using this format will help identify your contribution when you compare changes across forks and prepare your pull request.

## Make your changes

TODO: Add information about code linting standards and any project-specific tips for a successful contribution.

## Test and document

Without a working build and an acceptable level of documentation (screenshots, well-worded pull request with testing instrucitons)
